    "# 1 - Simple Question Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series, we'll develop a deep learning model capable of classifying questions into predefined categories using PyTorch and TorchText. This task will be performed on the [TREC question dataset](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/Data/QA/QC/), a collection of questions designed to be classified into a small set of categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this initial notebook, we aim to grasp the fundamental concepts without a primary focus on achieving high accuracy. Subsequent notebooks will expand upon this foundation to improve the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For analyzing sequences such as sentences in questions, we'll utilize a **recurrent neural network** (RNN). RNNs are particularly suited for sequence analysis, as they process sequences of words, $X=\\{x_1, ..., x_T\\}$, one at a time. Each word in the sequence is associated with a _hidden state_, $h$, which is updated sequentially. The RNN operates _recurrently_ by taking in the current word $x_t$ and the hidden state from the preceding word, $h_{t-1}$, to generate the next hidden state, $h_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_t = \\text{RNN}(x_t, h_{t-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon processing the last word in the question, $x_T$, and obtaining the final hidden state, $h_T$, this state is passed through a linear layer, $f$, to predict the question's category, $\\hat{y} = f(h_T)$."

    "## Preparing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For processing textual data in PyTorch, TorchText provides a powerful abstraction through the concept of `Field`. These define how to process your data, which, in the context of the TREC question classification task, includes the raw text of the question and its category label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fields Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "To process the questions and their labels, we define two fields: `TEXT` for the questions and `LABEL` for the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `TEXT` field specifies how the questions should be processed. We employ `tokenize='spacy'` as an argument to use the [spaCy](https://spacy.io) tokenizer, which is more sophisticated than simple space-based tokenization. This requires specifying `tokenizer_language` to indicate the spaCy model to use, typically `en_core_web_sm` for English text. This model must be downloaded prior to running your notebook using the command: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `LABEL` field is managed by a `LabelField`, a variant of the `Field` designed for handling categorical data. The `dtype` argument will be clarified subsequently, ensuring the labels are processed appropriately for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deeper dive into `Fields` and their configuration, refer to [this Documentation](https://torchtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html#field).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Seed for Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that our experiments can be replicated, we set the random seed at the beginning of our preprocessing script. This controls the randomness involved in splitting the dataset and initializing the model weights, making our results reproducible.\n"

The total number of unique words in the dataset defines the dimensionality of these one-hot vectors, often represented by $V$.\n",

    "Creating models in PyTorch involves a bit of standardized code. Observe how our `RNN` class extends `nn.Module`, leveraging `super` to initialize it properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the `__init__` method, we establish the model's _layers_. For our task, these include an _embedding_ layer, the RNN itself, and a _linear_ layer to output predictions. By default, these layers have randomly initialized parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _embedding_ layer transforms sparse one-hot vectors (mostly zeros) into dense embedding vectors. This layer acts as a fully connected network that not only reduces input dimensionality but also groups semantically similar words closer in the embedding space. Embeddings are crucial for capturing the nuances of language in a computationally efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following is the RNN layer, which processes the dense vector alongside the previous hidden state, $h_{t-1}$, to compute the subsequent hidden state, $h_t$. This recurrent processing allows the model to maintain a memory of past words as it moves through a sentence, essential for understanding the context and classifying questions accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step in our model involves the linear layer, which takes the RNN's last hidden state and projects it onto the space of our label categories, effectively determining the question's classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the `forward` method execution, we feed batches into our model. Each batch, `text`, is a tensor of dimensions _**[sentence length, batch size]**_, representing a batch of sentences where words are indicated by their indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though one might expect an additional dimension for one-hot vectors, PyTorch efficiently uses the index values directly, a process known as *numericalizing*.\n",
    "\n",
    "After passing through the embedding layer to obtain `embedded` (dimension _**[sentence length, batch size, embedding dim]**_), this tensor is input into the RNN. PyTorch's RNN can automatically start with an all-zero initial hidden state if none is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RNN outputs two tensors: `output`, with size _**[sentence length, batch size, hidden dim]**_, representing the hidden state across all steps, and `hidden`, size _**[1, batch size, hidden dim]**_, the final hidden state. We use `hidden` to confirm our understanding, applying `squeeze` to remove any singleton dimensions.\n",
